            <p>What would you do if you heard your daughter or sister has been raped? Just sit down and keep silent? In every 16 minutes, a woman was raped in India in 2019 alone. This woman could be your daughter, your sister or your friend. These worrying and disturbing events laid the foundation of NaariSamatā.</p>

               <p> NaariSamatā is a charitable organisation founded to work on the prevention of rape through youth awareness initiatives. It teaches the youth about gender equality and respect for women.</p>
                <p>The organisation was officially registered in Britain on 16th June, 2021 under the registration number 1194814.</p> 

                  <p>  We campaign for the safety of women, children, the under privileged and the marginalised communities. We work on issues related to gender, caste and sexuality. To build a safe world, we teach the youth about equality and mutual respect as a way of fighting violence against women. At our core is the empowerment of women and girls in India.</p>
